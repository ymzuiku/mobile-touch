# Makes the mobile web App closer to native App

ä¸­æ–‡æ–‡æ¡£: [README-CN](./README-CN.md)

The introduction of mobile-touch, if the device is a mobile device, can make the whole page scroll closer to native and support Typescript

Zero configuration, tiny, less than 1kb (Gzip)

## Install

```sh
npm i mobile-touch
```

## Feature

Touch:

1. Double-clicking the screen will not scale
2. Finger kneading won't zoom in on the screen

Scroll:

1. When the scroll area receives the scroll gesture, it can respond quickly and solve the problem of no response when switching overflow
2. Block all scrolling. Scrolling will not show the background of the browser

Keyboard:

1. When the iOS keyboard appears, click the blank area to automatically close the keyboard
2. Automatically adjust the scroll area when the iOS keyboard appears

## API

There is no necessary API, just need to import the library, if there is a need to scroll list, add a separate mobile-touch property

```js
import 'mobile-touch'

export default ()=>{
  return <div mobile-touch="true" className="page">
    <SomeComponents>
  </div>
}

```
